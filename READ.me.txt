Backend Part:

- As You mentioned for backend part I choose PHP and laravel framework.
- You can run and create db with artisan or you can use sql in sample folder.
- You can config database name and username, password of mysql on config/database.php file.
- I just add CORS header to resp for all requests to do not have problem with front end part requests.
